<!-- Goals
Project 5
In the previous modules and exercises we created file paths, file structures, linked HTML pages together, 
filled them with SEO details and then we learnt how to use Git and GitHub with their different commands 
while also learning how to create repositories. Now we will learn to upload our website from our local 
machine to GitHub, add pages, CSS/SCSS and collaborate on projects.

Note: You can use the previous files you created for building your website.

-Create your personal website with the correct file structure on your local machine - this file structure 
should include: (DONE)

a. One index.html page - this page should contain meta tags and all the HTML document linked appropriately (DONE)
b. At least three other pages you can link to ( you can use the ones from the previous exercise: about us, contact us, and products page) (DONE)
c. One CSS file and one optional Javascript file (DONE)
d. At least two images on any page of your choice (DONE)

-Upload and host your website to GitHub - name the repository after your websiteâ€™s name (DONE)
-Add one more additional page (DONE)
-Change the color and bold a sentence on any page using pull and merge commands (DONE! Main page and under introduction.)
-Invite collaborators through their GitHub username

        <p>
          Hello, my name is Joshua! I am currently working as a Transportation Associate for TOM Team (Transportation Operations Management) at Amazon. 
          I worked for Amazon for about 2 years and 6 months. Before working at Amazon, I worked at Harris Ranch Beef Company for about 10 years, learning 
          managerial skills and abilities as a trainer. Before actually working thou, I served in the military as a Mechanical Aircraft Engineer, in the Navy 
          branch. <br></p>
          <p>In regards to coding, I am in a course through Correlation One for Software Development, learning skills such as HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap v5.2, GitHub, 
          Wordpress, and now working towards Javascript. I also have experience in Back-End development, which involve SQL, MySQL, Java, Python, to a more specific 
          language, such as C# and Lua.<br></p>
