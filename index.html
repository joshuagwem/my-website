<!-- Goals
Week 4 Project
For this assignment, your task is to add advanced features to your “About Me” 
page. You should notice that your code is looking increasingly professional, 
and you are getting closer to having a potential employer looks at what you’ve 
created to showcase your skills.

For this project, you will be adding advanced css features to your page. You 
should make frequent use of pseudo-class and pseudo-element items, and include 
at least two or three of the following in your design:

a sass .scss sheet to produce your css file
media queries - DONE @css/styles.css at the very bottom
css animations - DONE @transition effects for buttons and images
advanced grid - DONE @Blog
flexbox - DONE @header
bootstrap - None included... everything is manually coded

        <p>Github.... Oh boy, was the lesson all over the place... LOL
          <br><br>It is rather simple to sign up for Github, connect accounts, and "push and commit". It's just 
          the actual steps given were rather... unique to say. <p style="font-size:6px;">Please don't kill me</p>
          This was a short week for me due to the amount of work I've been doing, covering for my manager, and 
          ongoing list of random "unfortunate" times. But, I shall not give up! Thank you for reading this short 
          day, but I shall continue my streak of actually doing these blogs.

        <p>Welcome again to my blog! Recent updates: been working a whole lot... Amazon sent lots of Mandatory 
          Extra Time my way (getting close to my 60hrs a week... *wipes sweat*), so it reduced my time to actually work on my site...  <em>HOWEVER~</em> I was 
          actually able to add an animation on what I always wanted... a running Chocobo gif on top of the screen. 
          Isn't that amazing? Anyways, I'm continuing building my website. I love the ease of access Bootstrap 
          has given to me... but I wanted to use actual code instead of "short-cutting", you know what I mean? <br><br>
          Anyways, my work in progress is as follows:
          <br><br> - Add a hamburger icon to the top right of the screen when in mobile mode
          <br> - Implement Javascript features
          <br> - Laugh a little once in a while
          <br> - Separate "Blog", "About Me", and "Contact Me" into separate websites for a cleaner look
          <br>
          Anyways! Thank you for reading, and hope you enjoy your day/afternoon/night!!! <br><br>
          -Joshua

        <p>Hello, welcome again to my blog! I'm still not used to typing blogs, but well, 
          there's always a start for everything, am I right? So far in my development journey, 
          we have learned how to use grids, implement links to images, and use CSS stylesheets! 
          Pretty impressive if I do say so myself. I do have a general idea due to my background 
          learning back-end development on my free time earlier this year, but my brain is loving 
          the new content. Thanks to all the TA's out there that helps out when things get rough, thou 
          I definitely want to give the biggest shout out to David Marshall. The way he delivers 
          his teaching method is amazing, but the biggest part of his deliverance is his gifs. Cannot 
          live without the gifs, which adds extra flair to the teaching method. Kudos to you! <br><br>
          Besides that, I also want to give the extra shout out to all the instructors we had so far! 
          I had the opportunity to grow as a software developer thanks to you all. So, thank you, 
          Correlation One! <br><br>
          Until next time~ Peace! <br><br>
          -Joshua <br><br> PS. Just to add a little more about myself, here are some cosplays I have cosplayed in the past. Enjoy!

          This may or may not be an excuse to do a quick requirement using grid... I don't know what you are talking about... *nervous in tiny letters*</p><br><br>

          This will be my first ever blog post I've created. I don't really know how to write down a 
          blog, but considering that I'm already typing down what's in my thoughts already, I believe 
          it is already turning into one...
        <p style="font-size:6px;">
          Hoping so anyways... *laughs in tiny letters*</p>
        <p>
          Either way, this is the beginning of my developing journey. Although I did had some development 
          background in regards to back-end server side, I was learning by myself. Joining Correlation One 
          so far, has actually given me the knowledge I need to further develop my skills as a developer. 
          I cannot wait to learn more, and hope to add more to my skillsets!

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I am a big video game video game enthusiast, 
          I play music (can even read sheet music!), I draw pixel art, cook food, do math, and- oh, 
          too specific? Anyways, I have created this website to show my current interest.
          Normally, I would either be playing video games or I will do lots and lots of pixel art. 
          I grew up with sidescrolling games like Mega Man X and Metroid, so majority of the music 
          I enjoy is based them. Oh and RPG's, how can I forget about them? Games like Final Fantasy, 
          then those SRPGs like Fire Emblem is what got me into the game's storyline. Since then, I've 
          been enjoying storylines that involves tragic change of events and... well... feels like watching 
          a soap opera, if I were to be honest. &#129315;<br><br>
